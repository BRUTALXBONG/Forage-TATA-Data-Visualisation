# SALES_DASHBOARD
This is a Virtual internship programme in which i used Excel and Power Bi for data cleaning, data analyzing, data visualization and creating data insights to answer business related questions.
## Introduction
An online retail store has hired me as a consultant to review their data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyse what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year. The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on whatâ€™s working. They would also like to view different metrics based on the demographic information that is available in the data.

Task 1: A meeting with the CEO and CMO has been scheduled for next month and I was askesd to draft the relevant analytics and insights that would help evaluate the current business performance and suggest metrics that would enable them to make the decision on expansion. To prepare for the meeting, I draft questions that I thought will be important and relevant to the CEO and CMO.  I thought both quantitatively and qualitatively and created a set of four questions that anticipated each business leader, and the questions I drafted and made sure I differentiate the questions, as both the CEO and CMO view business decisions through different lenses.

Task 2: I utilized Power BI to create visualizations for the questions posed by the CEO and CMO. Each visualization is presented on a separate tab, labeled with the corresponding question number.

Question 1 - Time Series Analysis (Tab: Q1):
I generated a time series line chart illustrating the monthly revenue data for the year 2011. This visualization allows the CEO to delve into granular details, identifying seasonal trends and patterns. By understanding why these trends occur, the CEO can make informed forecasts for the upcoming year.

Question 2 - Top 10 Revenue Generating Countries (Tab: Q2):
On the Q2 tab, I designed a bar chart showcasing the top 10 countries generating the highest revenue. Quantity sold is represented alongside revenue, excluding the United Kingdom as per the CMO's request. This visual provides a clear overview for the CMO to strategize marketing efforts and correlate revenue with sales quantity.

Question 3 - Top 10 Customers by Revenue (Tab: Q3):
For Q3, I created a stacked bar chart displaying the revenue contribution of the top 10 customers over time. The visualization begins with the greatest revenue-generating customer and gradually declines to lower contributors. This allows the CMO to focus on high-value customers, ensuring satisfaction and devising targeted strategies.

Question 4 - Demand Analysis by Region (Tab: Q4):
The Q4 tab features a heatmap showcasing product demand intensity across different regions. This single-view visual aids the CEO in gaining quick insights into regions with the highest demand. By excluding the United Kingdom, the CEO can focus on areas with potential expansion opportunities, streamlining the decision-making process.

All visualizations are presented in a clean and intuitive format, ensuring ease of interpretation for both the CEO and CMO during the upcoming meeting. The visuals are aligned with the objectives of strategic planning, marketing optimization, customer targeting, and expansion initiatives.

Task3: Developed a script and record a video presenting the findings to the CEO and CMO based on the four questions they asked and the visuals I created.
